At the beginning I used the unique function to calculate the total number of schools and students. For the total budget we needed to get rid of the repeating school names and then sum them up so I used drop duplicates. Then it’s all standard functions to calculate all the things required. 

On In [9] I changed the formula for calculating the average because it seemed wrong.

On In [18] we had a ready code that I used but I would have done it in a different way if it was me, it’s commented.

On In [26] I was getting an error on the line below so I checked the data types to see that the “Total Budget” is an object so we have to convert it to a float, then on the next cell I’m converting currency to float

I fixed a few spelling mistakes and I’m assuming bugs made by mistakes or miss clicks so I hope it’s all good 🙂

Everything runs with no errors and displays the correct data.
